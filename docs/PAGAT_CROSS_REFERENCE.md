### 2.2 Needs New Features

These games require engine features we currently lack.

#### "Buy Your Card" Games (needs BUY action)

Players pay chips to receive replacement cards from the deck or to purchase specific cards.

| # | Pagat Game | Pagat URL | Feature Needed |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | Baseball | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/baseball.html#baseball | Wild cards + buy extra card for a price |
| 2 | Night Baseball | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/baseball.html#night | No peek + wild + buy |
| 3 | Football | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/baseball.html#baseball_vars | Wild + buy (6s and 4s) |
| 4 | Woolworth | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/baseball.html#baseball_vars | Wild + buy at card cost |
| 5 | English Stud | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/7stud.html#english | Buy replacement card |
| 6 | Wall Street | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/buyyourcard.html#wall_street | Auction for community cards |
| 7 | Buy Your Card / Substitution | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/buyyourcard.html#buyyourcard | General buy mechanic |

| 9 | Grocery Store Dots | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/buyyourcard.html#grocery | Buy from community display |
| 10 | The Price is Right | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/buyyourcard.html#price | Bid for cards |
| 11 | Dakota | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/rollyourown.html#dakota | Roll your own + buy |
| 12 | Abyssinia | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/buyyourcard.html#abyssinia | Buy from other players |
| 13 | Swiss Hold'em | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/invented/shared.html#swiss | Buy community cards |
| 14 | Suicide Swiss Hold'em | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/invented/shared.html#suicide_swiss | Wild + buy |

| 19 | Double Trouble | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/invented/shared.html#double_trouble | Buy + hi-lo |

#### "Roll Your Own" (needs CHOOSE-which-to-reveal mechanic)

Players receive cards face down and choose which to turn face up. Different from our EXPOSE action (which flips specified cards after dealing) -- Roll Your Own is integrated into the deal sequence where each card dealt is followed by a player choice.

| # | Pagat Game | Pagat URL | Feature Needed |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 20 | Roll Your Own | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/rollyourown.html | Core roll-your-own mechanic. Our EXPOSE might handle this with a deal-then-expose grouped action. |
| 21 | Mexican Stud | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/rollyourown.html#mexican | Roll your own + stripped deck. Note: We already have `mexican_poker.json` which may use EXPOSE. |
| 22 | Mississippi Mud | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/rollyourown.html#mississippi | Roll your own + hi-lo |
| 23 | Pick a Partner | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/rollyourown.html#partner | Roll your own + partner split |
| 24 | Psycho | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/rollyourown.html#psycho | Roll your own draw + hi-lo |

**Note:** Our engine already has EXPOSE and grouped actions (deal + expose), which may already be sufficient for Roll Your Own. Mexican Poker is already in our configs, suggesting we may partially support this.

#### Dynamic Wild Cards (needs event-triggered wild card changes)

Wild cards change based on game events (cards dealt, folded, etc.).

| # | Pagat Game | Pagat URL | Feature Needed |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 25 | Follow The Queen | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/chicago.html#followqueen | Card dealt after a queen becomes wild; changes when new queen appears. |
| 26 | Low Hole Wild | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/7stud.html#lowhole | Each player's lowest hole card is wild (different per player). |
| 27 | Deuces & Jacks & Man with Axe | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/7stud.html#axe | Multiple static wild ranks. We support static wilds but this is more complex. |
| 28 | Good, Bad and Ugly | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/baseball.html#gbu | Three community cards: one makes a rank wild, one kills a rank, one is shared. |
| 29 | Jack the Shifter | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/baseball.html#shifter | Wild card shifts when jack is dealt. |
| 30 | Sequence | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/baseball.html#sequence | Cards must be turned in order; wilds dynamic. |

#### "No Peek" (needs card-reveal-on-beat mechanic)

Players don't look at their cards; reveal one at a time trying to beat the current best hand.

| # | Pagat Game | Pagat URL | Feature Needed |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 31 | No Peek | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/baseball.html#nopeek | Fundamental "no peek" mechanic: turn cards until you beat previous player. |
| 32 | Second Hand High | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/baseball.html#second | No peek variant. |
| 33 | Mexican Sweat | https://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/baseball.html#mexican | No peek variant of 7-card stud. |

#### Pass-Between-Players Games (complex passing patterns)

Our engine has PASS for passing cards between adjacent players. Some Pagat games require more complex passing.

| # | Pagat Game | Pagat URL | Feature Needed |

## Section 3: Missing Features Summary

Features prioritized by number of new games unlocked and casino relevance.

### Priority 1: Mixed Game Rotation

| | |
|-|-|
| **Feature** | Game rotation meta-layer |
| **Description** | A wrapper that cycles through multiple game configs (e.g., HORSE = Hold'em -> Omaha 8 -> Razz -> 7-Stud -> 7-Stud 8), switching every N hands or orbits. Needs to manage changing betting structures (stud uses antes, hold'em uses blinds) and player count limits across variants. |
| **New games unlocked** | ~10 (HORSE, 8 Game Mix, HOE, HOSE, SHOE, ROE, CHORSE, CHORSEL, Dealer's Choice + any custom rotation) |
| **Casino relevance** | **Very High** - HORSE and 8 Game Mix are standard tournament formats at WSOP. Dealer's Choice is the default home game format. |
| **Difficulty** | **Medium** - Not a single-game engine change; needs an orchestration layer above Game that swaps configs between hands. The individual games already work. |
| **Implementation approach** | Create a `MixedGame` class that wraps multiple `Game` instances and rotates. Track orbit counts, handle blind/ante transitions. |

### Priority 2: Buy Your Card

| | |
|-|-|
| **Feature** | BUY action (pay chips to acquire cards) |
| **Description** | During a hand, a player can pay a set price to receive an extra card from the deck, replace a card, or buy a specific card from a display. Variants: fixed price (Baseball: 3s cost 50 cents), auction (Wall Street), buy from display (Grocery Store Dots). |
| **New games unlocked** | ~19 (Baseball, Night Baseball, Football, Woolworth, English Stud, Wall Street, Substitution, Auction, Grocery Store Dots, Price is Right, Dakota, Abyssinia, Swiss Hold'em, Suicide Swiss, Dirty Schultz, Progressive Badugi w/Buy, King's Pot, Mutual of Omaha, Double Trouble) |
| **Casino relevance** | **Medium** - Mostly home game variants. Baseball and Football are popular in home games. English Stud has some history. |
| **Difficulty** | **Medium-Hard** - Needs a new PlayerAction.BUY, config schema for buy costs, integration with betting (is it a side-bet or part of the pot?). Auction variants are harder (need bidding round). |
| **Implementation approach** | Add BUY action type. In config: `{"buy": {"cost": "fixed", "amount": 50, "trigger": "rank", "ranks": ["3"]}}`. Fixed-cost buys are easiest; auctions need a bidding sub-round. |

### Priority 3: Dynamic Wild Cards

| | |
|-|-|
| **Feature** | Event-triggered wild card changes |
| **Description** | Wild cards that change based on game events. Types: (a) "Follow the Queen" - card dealt after a queen becomes wild, changes on each new queen; (b) "Low hole wild" - each player's lowest hole card is their personal wild; (c) "Shifting" - wild rank changes when specific cards appear. |
| **New games unlocked** | ~12 (Follow The Queen, Low Hole Wild, Deuces & Jacks & Axe, Good/Bad/Ugly, Jack the Shifter, Sequence, plus variants like Late Show, Low-Die, High-Die, 7 and What Makes It, and potentially many invented variants) |
| **Casino relevance** | **Medium** - Follow The Queen is one of the most popular home game variants ever. Low Hole Wild is also a home game staple. Not typically in casinos but very well-known. |
| **Difficulty** | **Hard** - Wild cards are currently static (set at game start). Dynamic wilds need: event hooks on each card dealt, per-player wild tracking for "low hole" variants, re-evaluation when wilds change. The evaluation pipeline needs to handle changing wild cards mid-hand. |
| **Implementation approach** | Add `wildCardRule` to config: `{"type": "follow", "trigger": "queen", "scope": "global"}` or `{"type": "low_hole", "scope": "per_player"}`. Hook into deal processing to update wilds. |

### Priority 4: No Peek Mechanic

| | |
|-|-|
| **Feature** | Blind card reveal / "no peek" game mode |
| **Description** | Players receive all cards face down and cannot look at them. Cards are revealed one at a time in turn order, and the player must beat the current best visible hand to stay in. Fundamentally different from normal stud dealing. |
| **New games unlocked** | ~4 (No Peek, Second Hand High, Mexican Sweat, Night Baseball partially) |
| **Casino relevance** | **Low** - Exclusively home game variants. Fun but not serious poker. |
| **Difficulty** | **Hard** - Requires a completely different game flow: no betting rounds between deals, instead a reveal-and-compare loop. Would need a new step type. |
| **Implementation approach** | New step type `{"nopeek": {"cards": 7}}`. Different game flow: deal all face down, then sequential reveal loop with "beat or fold" mechanic. |

### Priority 5: Enhanced Pass Mechanics

| | |
|-|-|
| **Feature** | Complex card passing patterns |
| **Description** | Multi-round passing (pass 3, then 2, then 1), accept/reject mechanics, pass to specific player (not just adjacent). Our engine has PASS but may need enhancements for these patterns. |
| **New games unlocked** | ~8 (Anaconda/Pass The Trash, Howdy Doody, Have a Heart, Selection/Rejection, Do Ya, Trees, Push, Crazy Blind Man) |
| **Casino relevance** | **Low-Medium** - Anaconda/Pass the Trash is well-known in home games. Others are niche. |
| **Difficulty** | **Easy-Medium** - Our PASS action already exists. May just need config enhancements for pass count, direction, and accept/reject sub-actions. |
| **Implementation approach** | Extend pass config: `{"pass": {"count": 3, "direction": "left", "rounds": [3, 2, 1]}}`. Add accept/reject option. |

### Priority 6: Inverted Visibility (Indian Poker)

| | |
|-|-|
| **Feature** | Cards visible to opponents but not to the holder |
| **Description** | Players hold cards on their foreheads -- everyone can see them except the player themselves. |
| **New games unlocked** | ~2 (Indian Poker, Blind Man's Buff) |
| **Casino relevance** | **Very Low** - Party game, not serious poker. |
| **Difficulty** | **Medium** - Our visibility system handles face-up/face-down. Would need a new visibility type "face out" where card is visible to all OTHER players but hidden from the owner. GameStateManager would need to flip the logic. |
| **Implementation approach** | Add `Visibility.FACE_OUT` enum value. In `_get_player_cards_with_visibility()`, show these cards to everyone except the owner. |

### Summary Table

| Priority | Feature | Games Unlocked | Casino Relevance | Difficulty |
|----------|---------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | Mixed Game Rotation | ~10 | Very High | Medium |
| 2 | Buy Your Card | ~19 | Medium | Medium-Hard |
| 3 | Dynamic Wild Cards | ~12 | Medium | Hard |
| 4 | No Peek Mechanic | ~4 | Low | Hard |
| 5 | Enhanced Pass Mechanics | ~8 | Low-Medium | Easy-Medium |
| 6 | Inverted Visibility | ~2 | Very Low | Medium |
| **Total** | | **~55** | | |
