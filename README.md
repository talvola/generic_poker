# generic_poker
Generic poker playing engine with configurable game rules

TODOs:
* Handle all players all-in better - i think the game will keep asking for decisions instead of knowing there are no betting decisions
* Handle dealing order - even though it might not really matter - the game is dealing to the button first instead of small blind
